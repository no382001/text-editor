- [rework] ui, enclose it into a resizable box, text size?
- [tcl] clean up code, package it

- [feat] history
- [feat] viewport horizontal offset
- [feat] save/load/open/close file

- [fix] add null termination in buffer-pool, could save a lot of converting cycles
- [fix] del should delete the prev char not the curr

c -> tcl:
  el <line> <col> // empty line
  ch <line> <col> <b64line>
  move <up/down/left/right>

tcl -> c -> tcl:
  viewport <n1> <n2>
  viewport <n1> <n2> <offset>
    -> n1..n2 -> ch <line> <col> <b64line> 
  key <line> <col> <button>
    -> ch <line> <col> <b64line>
  
  save -> cmdack | cmdnack
  save-as <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack
  open <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack
  close <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack

- the tcl cursor should stay on existing lines
- no segfaults, but some lines disappear when deleting
- sometimes when i delete from the file, the line disappears, but on viewport update ir reappears?
