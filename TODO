- history
  - undo/redo

- cursor movement is not really consistent, decide how the c -> tcl commands change cursor pos
  - introduce move_<up/down/left/right> command

- i might need to lose the indexing all-together, lots of line changes are expected
- [fix] add null termination in buffer-pool, could save a lot of converting cycles 
- \n is read into the line, it shouldnt be

c -> tcl:
  el <line> <col> // empty line
  ch <line> <col> <b64line>

tcl -> c -> tcl:
  viewport <n1> <n2>
  viewport <n1> <n2> <offset> -> n1..n2 -> ch <line> <col> <b64line> 
  key <line> <col> <button> -> ch <line> <col> <b64line>
