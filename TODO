- [tcl] clean up code, package them

c -> tcl:
  el <line> <col> // empty line
  ch <line> <col> <b64line>
  move <up/down/left/right>

tcl -> c -> tcl:
  viewport <n1> <n2>
  viewport <n1> <n2> <offset>
    -> n1..n2 -> ch <line> <col> <b64line> 
  key <line> <col> <button>
    -> ch <line> <col> <b64line>
  
  save -> cmdack | cmdnack
  save-as <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack
  open <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack
  close <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack

- the tcl cursor should stay on existing lines
- no segfaults, but some lines disappear when deleting
