find . -name "*.[ch]" -exec clang-format -i {} \;
valgrind --leak-check=full ./texteditor

- document index and cursor index are not in sync
- there are lots of pitfalls with pointer management, probably with the functions introduced in the prev commit
- there are 0 tests, perhaps its time to start writing them?
