- [rework] ui, enclose it into a resizable box, text size?
- [tcl] clean up code, package it

- [feat] history
- [feat] viewport horizontal offset

- [fix] del should delete the prev char not the curr

c -> tcl:
  el <line> <col> // empty line
  ch <line> <col> <b64line>
  move <up/down/left/right>
  echo <tcl -> c command>s delimited by `;`, or just 1 without `;`  

tcl -> c -> tcl:
  viewport <n1> <n2>
  viewport <n1> <n2> <offset>
    -> n1..n2 -> ch <line> <col> <b64line> 
  key <line> <col> <button>
    -> ch <line> <col> <b64line>
  
  save -> cmdack | cmdnack
  save-as <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack
  open <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack
  close <fn> -> cmdack | cmdnack

[ ] the tcl cursor should stay on existing lines
  - problem with $BUFFER, when there is nothing to display, move cursor shifts the lines out of the buffer, but there is still a line that can be navigated, bc its a fixed buffer, only appended into

- no segfaults, but some lines disappear when deleting
  - this should be the same bug as below
[ ] sometimes when i delete from the file, the line disappears, but on viewport update ir reappears?
  - request update on, see if this fixes it


- viewport offset fucks up when somethingis modified, but only when the modification is offscreen (line num bigger than max lines we are able to show)
- sometimes lines get stuck

[x] implement open and close
[x] `echo` command, no current use tho

[ ] startup command could be more than 1 line

[ ] - the vertical offset is not calculated into the key send? or something like that
  - to replicate, scroll down, go back a little, modify
[ ] - weird newline leak, replated to above 

[ ] - the cursor is totally out of sync, suggesting entire gui rewrite
